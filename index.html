            <h1>Emily Carter</h1>
            <p>Three years ago, I re-entered the workforce after a six-year hiatus as a stay-at-home mom. Since then, I’ve earned multiple certifications and built experience in customer service, curriculum development, and project coordination. With a background in behavioral science, e-commerce, and EdTech, I work cross-functionally to align curriculum with state standards, streamline operations, and enhance the customer experience. I’m currently pursuing my Salesforce Admin certification to deepen my expertise in CRM systems, automation, and scalable onboarding. Certifications include Salesforce CRM, Scrum Master, Business Analysis, Digital Marketing, Talent Acquisition, and more. My academic training in organizational behavior, social psychology, and learning theory informs my people-first, systems-driven approach. Outside of work, I’m an audiobook lover, travel enthusiast, and occasional Disney explorer—always curious, always learning.</p>
