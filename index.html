     <p> <h2>About Me</h2></p>
    <div class="intro"></div>
      <p>Three years ago, I re-entered the workforce after a six-year hiatus as a stay-at-home mom. Since then, I’ve earned multiple certifications and built experience in customer service, curriculum development, and project coordination. With a background in behavioral science, e-commerce, and EdTech, I work cross-functionally to align curriculum with state standards, streamline operations, and enhance the customer experience. My academic training in organizational behavior, social psychology, and learning theory informs my people-first, systems-driven approach. Outside of work, I’m an audiobook lover, travel enthusiast, and occasional Disney explorer—always curious, always learning.</p>
